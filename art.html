              This dark painting captures an oxymoronic image of a jester, Marotte and all, that is immensely serious and concerned.

              The imagery of the crowd in the next room and the jester sitting alone reminds me of the sensation of closing one's eyes in a busy environment. All the noise in the background blends into a singular rhythm - a hum - and one escapes into their mind.

              This painting is of Stańczyk, a polish court jester. Famous for his craft, he was a well-known legend in his own time. Repopuliarised in the 19th and 20th centuries, Stańczyk was depicted in many paintings, including this one by Jan Matejko in 1862.

              Historically, Stańczyk was far more than a mere entertainer. He was a philosopher and satirical truth-teller. An idealism of comedy, he used jokes to highlight hypocrisy, and he did so wittingly - as demonstrated by his service to three Polish kings.
